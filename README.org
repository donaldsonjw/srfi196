* SRFI-196: Range Objects

** Description
  The srfi library is an implementation of [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-196/srfi-196.html][SRFI 196]] for Bigloo
  Scheme. It is an adaption of the sample implentation by Wolfgang
  Corcoran-Mathe to Bigloo Scheme. 

** Building
  Both the bigloo native and jvm backends are supported. To build,
  execute:
    #+begin_src shell
  ./configure --prefix=<installation path prefix>; make
#+end_src
  where =<installation path prefix>= is the desired installation path
  prefix (e.g, =/usr/local=). You usually want the path prefix to match
  that used by Bigloo itself.
  
** Installation
  To install the library, execute:
#+begin_src shell
  make install
#+end_src 

** Tests
To run the tests execute:

  #+begin_src shell
  make test
#+end_src
